# Professor-rating-quality-prediction

## Main Objective
The primary goal of this project is to perform sentiment analysis on comments from the RateMyProfessors website. We aim to predict the quality and difficulty scores for professors' teaching based on the comments provided by students.

## Tasks Performed
1. **Data Collection**
   - Mount new drive into Google Colab and add datasets into the new drive.
2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis, including handling missing values and normalizing text.
3. **Word Embeddings**
   - Utilizing GloVe and Word2Vec models to create word embeddings for the text data.
4. **Data Splitting**
   - Splitting the datasets into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance effectively.
5. **Model Training**
   - Training different models on the dataset to predict the quality and difficulty scores.
6. **Result Analysis**
   - Analyzing the results by comparing the models and selecting the best model for prediction based on performance metrics.

## Data Collection
1. **Mounting Drive**
   - In this step, we mount a new drive into Google Colab and add the necessary datasets into the drive for further processing and analysis.

## Getting Started
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.
